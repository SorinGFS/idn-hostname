# IDN Hostname

`idn-hostname` validates internationalized hostnames and converts valid input to ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE). It combines:

- nontransitional [Unicode 17.0 UTS #46](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/tr46-35.html) preprocessing;
- IDNA2008 label validation from [RFC 5890](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5890), [RFC 5891](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5891), [RFC 5892](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892), and [RFC 5893](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5893);
- Punycode encoding and decoding from [RFC 3492](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3492).

The bundled table targets Unicode 17.0.0. The package is CommonJS and depends on [`punycode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/punycode). Browser use requires a bundler or runtime that supports those modules; the package does not declare a browser compatibility guarantee.

The supported Node.js range is `>=24.13.1 <25 || >=26.0.0`. [Node.js 24.13.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.13.1) is the first LTS release in the 24.x line to bundle ICU 78.2; [ICU 78](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/download/78.html) updates Unicode properties, normalization data, and IDNA data to Unicode 17. Node.js 24.13.0 and earlier use ICU 77.1, and Node.js 25 also uses ICU 77.1, so those runtimes cannot provide the Unicode 17 behavior required by this release. Node.js 26 starts with ICU 78.3 and is compatible. The package bundles its own UTS #46 table, but its normalization and Unicode-property checks still require matching runtime Unicode data.

## Install

```sh
npm install idn-hostname@17
```

## API

### Validate a hostname

`isIdnHostname(hostname)` returns `true` or throws a `SyntaxError` object with a specific error `name` at the first detected violation.

```js
const { isIdnHostname } = require('idn-hostname');

try {
    isIdnHostname('mañana.example');
    console.log('valid');
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.name, error.message);
}
```

### Convert a hostname to ACE

`idnHostname(hostname)` validates the input and returns its ASCII form.

```js
const { idnHostname } = require('idn-hostname');

try {
    console.log(idnHostname('mañana.example'));
    // xn--maana-pta.example
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.name, error.message);
}
```

### Apply UTS #46 preprocessing to one label

`uts46map(label)` applies the package's nontransitional, STD3-disabled preprocessing policy. It does not perform NFC normalization or the complete final IDNA2008 validation.

```js
const { uts46map } = require('idn-hostname');

try {
    const label = uts46map('ＡＢＣ').normalize('NFC');
    console.log(label); // abc
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.name, error.message);
}
```

### Access the Punycode dependency

The exported `punycode` object is the low-level dependency, not a replacement for IDNA validation. Use `idnHostname` when converting a hostname for use.

```js
const { punycode } = require('idn-hostname');

console.log(punycode.toUnicode('xn--maana-pta')); // mañana
```

## Processing model

The validator uses a narrow ASCII fast path and otherwise deliberately separates compatibility preprocessing from final eligibility. Before entering the Unicode pipeline, `isIdnHostname` directly accepts a non-reserved ASCII LDH hostname when:

- every label contains only ASCII letters, digits, and internal hyphens;
- every label contains 1–63 characters;
- no label contains `--` in the third and fourth positions;
- the complete presentation form contains at most 253 characters.

Reserved labels, including labels beginning with `xn--`, continue through the complete IDNA validation pipeline. `idnHostname` still applies UTS #46 mapping when producing its result, so uppercase ASCII input is returned in lowercase. Inputs that do not meet the fast-path constraints follow these steps:

1. Split the hostname at UTS #46 label separators and reject empty labels, including a trailing root label.
2. Apply nontransitional UTS #46 mappings with STD3 rules disabled.
3. Normalize ordinary Unicode input to NFC.
4. Recognize and decode an ACE prefix after preprocessing, so case and compatibility mappings cannot hide or create an unchecked prefix.
5. Require a decoded A-label to already be NFC; decoded Punycode is not remapped or normalized into validity.
6. Check every resulting code point against the final/default IDNA table.
7. Apply hyphen, leading-mark, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO, bidi, ACE round-trip, and DNS length checks.

This order permits sequences such as Hangul Jamo to compose into an eligible syllable during NFC while still rejecting mapped output that remains ineligible.

<details>
<summary><strong>Complete validation pipeline</strong></summary>

For each hostname, the implementation:

1. Requires a JavaScript string.
2. Accepts a hostname satisfying the non-reserved ASCII LDH fast-path constraints without Unicode table, contextual, Punycode, or bidi validation.
3. For remaining input, splits labels on U+002E, U+FF0E, U+3002, and U+FF61.
4. Rejects leading, trailing, or consecutive separators because they create an empty label.
5. Determines whether the hostname requires RFC 5893 bidi enforcement.
6. Preserves the existing raw non-ASCII A-label syntax check before preprocessing.
7. Applies `uts46map` and NFC to ordinary input.
8. If the preprocessed label starts with `xn--`:
   - requires ASCII input;
   - decodes the Punycode payload;
   - rejects an empty or all-ASCII decoded U-label;
   - requires the decoded U-label to already be NFC;
   - requires exact decode/re-encode agreement after preprocessing has normalized the ACE label's case.
9. Converts the resulting label to ASCII for length accounting and requires at most 63 ASCII octets.
10. Rejects a leading or trailing hyphen and hyphens in positions 3 and 4 of a U-label.
11. Rejects a leading Unicode mark.
12. Spreads the label into code points once and uses the existing per-code-point loop to:
    - require final `valid` or nontransitional `deviation` eligibility;
    - enforce CONTEXTJ and CONTEXTO rules;
    - enforce RFC 5893 bidi rules when the hostname is bidi.
13. Requires the complete ASCII presentation form, without a trailing root dot, to contain at most 253 octets.

The 63-octet label limit and 255-octet DNS wire-format limit come from the DNS size limits described by RFC 1035 and RFC 5890. The implementation's 253-character presentation-form limit accounts for separators while intentionally disallowing a trailing root dot.

</details>

## Enforced label rules

<details>
<summary><strong>Hyphen, normalization, ACE, and leading-mark rules</strong></summary>

- A label cannot begin or end with U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.
- A U-label cannot contain hyphens in positions 3 and 4.
- A label cannot begin with a Unicode character in General Category `M`.
- An apparent A-label must contain only ASCII after preprocessing and must decode successfully.
- A decoded A-label must produce a non-ASCII U-label in NFC and round-trip through Punycode.
- Final code points must be eligible after preprocessing and normalization.

References: RFC 5890 §2.3.2.1; RFC 5891 §4.2.3 and §5.4; UTS #46 §4.1.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CONTEXTJ and CONTEXTO rules</strong></summary>

The validator implements checks for every RFC 5892 Appendix A contextual-rule family, including CONTEXTO checks that lookup-only applications are not universally required to evaluate:

- **U+200C ZWNJ:** accepted after a virama or when its joining-type context satisfies RFC 5892 Appendix A.1.
- **U+200D ZWJ:** accepted only immediately after a virama.
- **U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT:** accepted only between two lowercase ASCII `l` characters after preprocessing. An uppercase `L` in ordinary input is mapped to lowercase before this check.
- **U+0375 GREEK LOWER NUMERAL SIGN:** must be followed by a Greek-script character.
- **U+05F3/U+05F4 Hebrew punctuation:** must follow a Hebrew-script character.
- **U+30FB KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT:** requires at least one Hiragana, Katakana, or Han character in the label.
- **Arabic digit sets:** U+0660–U+0669 and U+06F0–U+06F9 cannot occur together in one label.

Reference: RFC 5892 Appendix A.1–A.9.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Bidirectional-text rules</strong></summary>

If the hostname contains an RTL label, every label is checked under RFC 5893:

- an RTL label must begin with `R` or `AL`, use only the permitted classes, and end with `R`, `AL`, `EN`, or `AN`, followed by optional `NSM` characters;
- an RTL label cannot mix `EN` and `AN` digits;
- an LTR label must begin with `L`, use only the permitted classes, and end with `L` or `EN`, followed by optional `NSM` characters.

Reference: RFC 5893 §2.

</details>

## Unicode data

The deployment JSON is generated directly from authoritative Unicode 17.0.0 text files:

- [`IdnaMappingTable.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/idna/IdnaMappingTable.txt) — UTS #46 statuses, mappings, and IDNA-version markers;
- [`DerivedCombiningClass.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedCombiningClass.txt) — canonical combining class 9 entries used as viramas;
- [`DerivedJoiningType.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedJoiningType.txt) — joining types used by the ZWNJ contextual rule;
- [`DerivedBidiClass.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedBidiClass.txt) — bidi classes used by RFC 5893 checks.

`IdnaMappingTable.txt` is a UTS #46 data file, not the RFC 5892 derived-property table. The generator uses its `NV8` and `XV8` markers to keep preprocessing permission separate from final IDNA2008 eligibility.

The validator ships one table and does not select a Unicode version at runtime.

<details>
<summary><strong>Compact JSON schema and current counts</strong></summary>

`idnaMappingTableCompact.json` contains:

| Member | Purpose | Unicode 17.0 count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `props` | Property names: `valid`, `mapped`, `deviation`, `ignored`, `disallowed` | 5 |
| `ranges` | Final/default property ranges | 2,078 |
| `uts46_ranges` | Preprocessing overrides used only when UTS #46 differs from `ranges` | 468 |
| `mappings` | Non-empty preprocessing mappings keyed by source code point | 6,377 |
| `viramas` | Code points with canonical combining class 9 | 69 |
| `bidi_ranges` | Explicit bidi-class ranges | 1,611 |
| `joining_type_ranges` | Explicit joining-type ranges | 529 |

During preprocessing, `uts46_ranges` takes precedence and lookup falls back to `ranges`. After mapping and NFC—or after unmodified ACE decoding—final validation consults only `ranges` and accepts `valid` or `deviation`.

Missing final/default ranges are treated as disallowed or unassigned. Deviation mappings are omitted because processing is nontransitional and leaves deviation code points unchanged.

</details>

## Errors

The API stops at the first fatal violation. Each validator function (`isIdnHostname`, `idnHostname`, and `uts46map`) may throw a `SyntaxError` object with one of these names:

<details>
<summary><strong>Error names and responsibilities</strong></summary>

| Error name | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `IdnaUnicodeError` | Disallowed, unassigned, or finally ineligible code point |
| `IdnaSyntaxError` | General label syntax, normalization, mark, or hyphen failure |
| `IdnaLengthError` | Empty label or DNS label/hostname length failure |
| `IdnaContextJError` | ZWNJ or ZWJ contextual failure |
| `IdnaContextOError` | Other RFC 5892 contextual failure |
| `IdnaBidiError` | RFC 5893 bidi failure |
| `PunycodeError` | ACE decoding, re-encoding, or ASCII conversion failure |

Messages include the relevant RFC or UTS reference. Error precedence follows the validator's processing order and is part of its current behavior.

</details>

## Intentional policy and limitations

- Processing is nontransitional; the deprecated transitional mappings are not offered.
- STD3 ASCII rules are disabled during preprocessing. This does not make otherwise ineligible code points valid after NFC.
- The validator rejects a trailing root dot instead of accepting an absolute/FQDN presentation form.
- It evaluates every implemented CONTEXTO rule, including during lookup-style use.
- It performs no locale-specific casing or registration-policy processing.
- It does not query DNS, determine whether a name is registered, or apply registry-specific script, confusability, or security policies.
- Validation establishes conformance with this implementation's syntax and policy; it does not guarantee that a browser, resolver, registry, or registrar will accept the name.

## Verification

Tests and benchmarks are maintained in [SorinGFS/public-data](https://github.com/SorinGFS/public-data) rather than in the package or canonical repository. The [gh-workspace-data](https://github.com/SorinGFS/gh-workspace-data) extension materializes those concerns together with the shared `#/version-layers.js` runtime required by both dispatchers.

<details>
<summary><strong>gh-workspace-data usage</strong></summary>

Install the GitHub CLI extension once:

```sh
gh extension install SorinGFS/gh-workspace-data
```

Initialize and load workspace data from the cloned project repository:

```sh
gh workspace-data init
gh workspace-data load
```

The extension materializes ordinary local files under `#/public/tests/` and `#/public/benchmarks/`, while `#/version-layers.js` provides deterministic version-layer discovery. The generated `#/` namespace remains excluded from the canonical Git repository and npm package.

Run `gh workspace-data load` again to refresh materialized data after public-data changes or an extension upgrade.

</details>

### Tests

Package fixtures remain in delta-only Unicode scopes: `v15.1` contains 108 cases, `v16.0` contains seven additions, and `v17.0` contains seven additions. Because `#/public/tests/index.json` marks the validation callback as backwards compatible, the dispatcher runs numeric fixtures from every version layer not newer than the installed package while keeping explicit conformance concerns exact-scoped. For the current 17.0 release line, the active suite contains 6,324 independently reported tests: all 122 eligible package fixtures and all 6,202 applicable nontransitional Unicode 17.0.0 `IdnaTestV2.txt` vectors.

<details>
<summary><strong>Test details</strong></summary>

Install package dependencies and run the materialized suite:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

The suite uses the `node:test` module built into Node.js and requires no separate test-runner dependency. Its deterministic dispatcher processes eligible version layers, numbered JSON fixtures, and explicit nonnumeric suite entry points in defined order. `#/public/tests/index.json` selects the package's `isIdnHostname` callback and declares it backwards compatible, so numeric package fixtures accumulate semantically without being copied between version folders. Explicit concern suites retain exact-scope selection, and the matching Unicode conformance concern receives the complete package API from the root dispatcher.

Each applicable `IdnaTestV2.txt` vector exercises both `isIdnHostname` and `idnHostname`; valid conversions must equal the expected nontransitional ToASCII result. Applicability excludes otherwise-valid `NV8`/`XV8` inputs permitted by default UTS #46 but rejected by this package's IDNA2008 policy and valid trailing-root inputs rejected by the package's presentation policy. `U1` statuses are ignored because preprocessing uses `UseSTD3ASCIIRules=false`. CONTEXTO classification remains covered by the version-specific package fixtures rather than by the Unicode concern's applicability logic.

The Unicode fixture registrar verifies that the runtime's Unicode data is at least version 17.0 before registering vectors. The materialized `#/public/tests/README.md` documents the portable layout, and `#/public/tests/v17.0/idna-test-v2/README.md` documents source provenance and applicability rules.

`npm test` exits unsuccessfully when configuration, fixture loading, suite registration, conversion output, or a test fails. Continuous integration is configured to run the suite on the exact minimum Node.js 24.13.1 LTS runtime and the current compatible Node.js 26 release across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.

</details>

### Benchmarks

The materialized benchmark suite provides portable, version-aware measurements for package loading and the three package-owned function exports, including separate ASCII and internationalized inputs for both `isIdnHostname` and `idnHostname`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Benchmark details</strong></summary>

Run the standard workload:

```sh
npm run benchmark
```

Run a reduced workload with machine-readable output for CI smoke checks or artifacts:

```sh
node ./#/public/benchmarks --quick --json
```

Direct invocation also supports an explicit iteration count; `npm run benchmark` retains the standard 100,000 iterations per sample:

```sh
node ./#/public/benchmarks --iterations 250000
```

The harness records five initial calls, warmed minimum/median/p95/maximum latency in milliseconds with six decimal places, integer operations per second, representative arguments, workload counts, and environment metadata. Its generic coordinator supports the same optional `backwardsCompatible` version-layer selection through `#/public/benchmarks/index.json` when versioned benchmark concerns are introduced. The materialized `#/public/benchmarks/README.md` documents concern registration, version eligibility, workload controls, output fields, and guidance for noisy CI runners. Benchmark values are observations rather than correctness assertions.

</details>

## Versioning

The package version identifies the Unicode version targeted by its bundled data. The major and minor package-version components correspond to the Unicode major and minor version, while the patch component identifies package fixes and revisions that retain the same Unicode target.

Each release ships one Unicode data table and does not select a table at runtime. Runtime compatibility and selection of an appropriate package release are the consumer's responsibility.

When a release changes the targeted Unicode version, its documentation describes compatibility with the preceding release line and identifies any known cases in which input accepted by that preceding release becomes invalid.

The `17.0.x` release line targets Unicode 17.0.0 and follows the `16.0.x` release line, which targets Unicode 16.0.0. Unicode 17.0 expands the accepted repertoire. Comparison of the complete compact tables found no change to final eligibility, preprocessing behavior, mappings, viramas, bidi classes, or joining types that invalidates an input accepted by the 16.0 release line.
